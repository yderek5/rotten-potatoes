## Rotten Potatoes
Doesn't it seem kind of unfair that game review websites like IGN only have ONE author to decide what they rate the game?<br />
Rotten Potatoes is a web application where the gaming community as a whole decide on the rating of games.__
Each review towards a game rates the gameplay, replayability, graphics, and soundtrack, and all that is averaged into an overall score.<br />
From there every review's overall score is averaged into one score giving the game the rating of rotten, fresh, or fully baked.
